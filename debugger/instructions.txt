## Power on

Power on oscilloscope.
Turn on Microcomp's power supply while it's disconnected from Microcomp.
Apply power to Microcomp. Amber power LED should turn on.
Power on STK500.
Plug STK500's USB/serial port into laptop.
Plug LPC1769 board into USB port to power it on. I use my laptop as the USB port.
Check for /dev/ttyUSB* files. Find the one that connects to Microcomp through the STK500. Change duckLisp-dev.c to use that port and recompile.
Run duckLisp-dev and pass it "hal.dl". Assuming I didn't change anything, this will write the memory and then dump the memory. What was written and what was read needs to match. Save the output to a file for future reference.
Save a trace of the malfunctioning pins.

## Power off

Unplug all USB devices.
Power off STK500.
Detach power from Microcomp.
Power off Microcomp's power supply.
