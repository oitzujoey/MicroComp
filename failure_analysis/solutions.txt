Attempt #1:
    Modifications:
        Three registers on the output of the microcode ROMs. These registers are then used as the real microcode.
        Clock the instruction register with an inverted copy of the clock. This is ORed with the IRLD signal. This will add a wait state during IR load, but at least it should work.
    Chips:
        3x  74*574
        1/4 74*32
        1/6 74*04
        Total is 5 chips.
