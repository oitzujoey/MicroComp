Attempt #1:
    Modifications:
        Three registers on the output of the microcode ROMs. These registers are then used as the real microcode.
        Clock the instruction register with an inverted copy of the clock. This is ORed with the IRLD signal. This will add a wait state during IR load, but at least it should work.
    Chips:
        3x  74*574
        1/4 74*32
        1/6 74*04
        Total is 5 chips.

It might be a good idea to use microcode output registers that reset to a known state and then use inverters to get the proper polarity. I don't know if this is really needed since shorts should be a problem for a max of one clock cycle. This could actually cause problems with race conditions, but the rest of the design should be made to elimiate those.

I also have a microcode update that I can't program into the flash. I will have to buy or build a programmer.
