The emulator will be able to run MicroComp programs without modification.
The programs can be loaded as an Intel HEX file, a text file with hex code, a text file with binary code, or an assembly language file.
The emulator will use microcode files from the workspace folder.
The microcode will be encoded in Intel HEX, ASCII binary, or ASCII hexadecimal.
The emulator will look for a configuration file on startup.
The configuration file will tell the emulator:
	where to get the microcode
	what format the microcode will be in
	whether to run the program on startup
	what program to run on startup
	what format the program will be in
	where breakpoints are set
	the size of memory
The configuration file format is not case sensitive.
When a breakpoint is hit, the computer will dump the registers into one file, and the memory into another file.
